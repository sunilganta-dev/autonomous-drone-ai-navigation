# 🚀 Autonomous Drone for Intelligent Navigation

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to design and implement a **fully autonomous drone** capable of flying from an origin to a destination **without human control**, while intelligently **avoiding obstacles**, adapting to **environmental conditions** (such as wind, GPS drift, or limited visibility), and making **AI-based flight decisions** in real time.

This project integrates **sensor fusion**, **computer vision**, and **PWM-based control** through a companion computer to achieve safe, efficient, and intelligent flight performance.

## ⚙️ System Overview

### Core Concept  
To create a drone that can **perceive**, **plan**, and **act** on its own — continuously interpreting its surroundings, predicting potential collisions, and dynamically adjusting its flight path to maintain stability and safety.

| **Subsystem** | **Description** |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Flight Controller** | Cube Orange+ / Pixhawk 6X running ArduPilot or PX4 firmware for low-level stabilization and motor control |
| **Companion Computer** | NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX handling perception, SLAM, object detection, and path planning |
| **Sensors** | GPS, IMU, TF Luna LiDAR, barometer, ultrasonic sensors, and camera modules for navigation and obstacle avoidance |
| **Communication** | MAVLink telemetry over UART connecting the Jetson to the flight controller |
| **Power System** | 4S LiPo battery with LM2596 step-down converter supplying stable power to all onboard components |

## 🧠 Control Logic

- All analog input signals (e.g., sensor readings or trigger inputs) are represented using **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** for unified processing.  
- PWM is used for:  
  - **Motor control** through ESCs  
  - **Sensor signal emulation** for analog interfacing  
- **Failsafe Logic:**  
  - Automatic *Return-to-Home (RTH)* or hover behavior on signal loss or low-battery detection

## 🧩 Development Phases

| **Phase** | **Goal / Deliverable** |
|------------|------------------------|
| **1. Research & Design** | Finalize system architecture, select flight controller, companion computer, and sensors |
| **2. Hardware Assembly** | Mount frame, motors, ESCs, Pixhawk, and Jetson; integrate power distribution and verify PWM output |
| **3. Firmware & Software Setup** | Flash ArduPilot/PX4, configure Mission Planner or QGroundControl, and establish Jetson–Pixhawk MAVROS communication |
| **4. Sensor Calibration & Testing** | Calibrate IMU, GPS, LiDAR, barometer, and camera modules; validate indoor stability |
| **5. AI Navigation Algorithm** | Implement SLAM, object detection, and path-planning logic on Jetson for autonomous navigation |
| **6. Field Testing & Evaluation** | Perform outdoor test flights, record telemetry, analyze obstacle-avoidance accuracy and failsafe response |
| **7. Documentation & Presentation** | Deliver final report, architecture diagram, and live flight demonstration |
